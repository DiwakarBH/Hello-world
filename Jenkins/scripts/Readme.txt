CI/CD Deployments Readme 

Introduction 
This readme file provides an overview and guidelines for CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) deployments in our organization. The purpose of CI/CD is to automate the software delivery process, ensuring faster and more reliable deployments while maintaining the quality and stability of our services.

1. Overview 
CI/CD deployments are designed to streamline the software delivery lifecycle, from code changes to production deployment. By automating the build, testing, and deployment processes, we can achieve faster delivery cycles and reduce the risk of human errors. 

2. CI/CD Workflow 
Our CI/CD workflow encompasses the following key stages: 
● Code Changes: Developers commit code changes to the designated repository.
● Continuous Integration: The CI system initiates the pipeline and performs a Cython compilation check. If the code successfully passes the Cython compilation, the DevOps team receives a build approval request. Once approved, the pipeline proceeds to build the r1 image. 
● Continuous Deployment: After the code changes have passed the Cython compilation and the image is successfully built, the changes are automatically deployed to the production environment. 
● Declarative: Post Actions: In the event of a pipeline failure, the Post Actions are triggered, and an email notification is sent to the DevOps team with attached logs for analysis. 

3. Files Required 
To ensure a smooth CI/CD process, the following files are required: 
● Dockerfile 
● Jenkinsfile 
● Main 
● devops-mail.txt 

Note: 
● Make sure the script name should be index.py, the Git repository name should be in lowercase, and the Branch name should be “main” 

4. Deployment Process 

To initiate a deployment, follow these steps: 
1. Push your code changes to the designated repository. 
2. The CI system will automatically trigger a Jenkins pipeline and build the image. 3. Once the changes are verified, the CI system will automatically deploy them to the production environment. 
Ensure that your code changes are thoroughly tested and reviewed before pushing them to the repository. 

5. Monitoring and Rollbacks
It's essential to monitor the deployed services to ensure their stability and performance. In case of any issues or unexpected behavior, a rollback may be required. To perform a rollback: 
1. Identify the problematic release or version. 
2. Revert the changes by rolling back to the previous stable version. 3. Investigate and resolve the issues causing the rollback. 
4. Resume the regular deployment process once the issues are resolved. 

6. Resources and Support 
For further assistance or guidance with CI/CD deployments, please reach out to our DevOps team. We can provide additional resources, answer questions, and help resolve any issues you may encounter during the deployment process. 
Remember, CI/CD is an ongoing process, and we encourage continuous improvement and innovation to enhance our deployment capabilities and deliver high-quality services to our customers. 
Happy deploying!
